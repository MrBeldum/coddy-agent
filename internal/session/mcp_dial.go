package session

// The configured MCP servers of a session are dialed here: the trust-gated
// target list, the concurrent dial with one timeout per server, the log
// lines and the warnings a settings reload reports. Session creation, the
// subagent spawn, the console's background connect and the hot reloads all
// reach a spawn through these helpers, so none of them can start a server
// the trust gate did not admit, and none of them waits on one server longer
// than its own bound, whatever its transport: a stdio command that never
// answers initialize and a remote URL that accepts the connection and stays
// silent cost the same.
