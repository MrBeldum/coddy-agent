// relay is not its operator, the same reason registration is refused through
// a mount. Reading them is ordinary; the credentials in them are write-only.
//
// rest is the mount's remainder as it arrived, still escaped. The node routes
// on the decoded path, so the route is judged decoded too: /coddy/%63onfig is
// /coddy/config to the node. mountRemainder has already refused a remainder
