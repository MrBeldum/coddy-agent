# Skills

Skills are reusable instruction packs that extend the agent with slash commands, domain knowledge, and specialized workflows. They power the **`{{.Skills}}`** block in the system prompt and the slash-command catalog surfaced to ACP clients and the HTTP UI.

> **Project rules** (`.coddy/rules`, `.cursor/rules`, etc.) are a separate mechanism injected as **`{{.Rules}}`**. Do not place rules in `skills.dirs`. See [rules.md](rules.md).

## The standard delivery

Coddy carries a set of skills inside the binary and writes them into **`${CODDY_HOME}/skills`** the
first time it sees they are not there. Nothing is downloaded for this: a fresh install has them on
the first run, offline, and a skill that reads files beside its `SKILL.md` finds them on disk rather
than pointing at a directory that does not exist.

| Skill | What it does |
|-------|--------------|
| **`/configure-coddy`** | Changes Coddy's own configuration when you ask: settings, providers, models, logging, permissions, MCP servers and skills. Verifies the upstream source, stages uci-style edits with the typed `config_get` / `config_set` tools, and commits only after you confirm, so `config_commit` applies and hot-reloads them in one step; `config_rollback` returns to the pre-commit snapshot. Never echoes secrets. |
| **`/crossreview`** | Sends one review brief to a quorum of reviewers that stay blind to each other - external console code agents (Claude Code, Codex, Coddy, Cursor Agent, Devin, OpenCode, Gemini CLI, Qwen Code, Kimi, Koda) and internal `explore` children - through the bundled `crossreview` coordinator, which collects every answer, verifies each finding against the code and decides alone what to fix. The first run (and `/crossreview:setup` later) detects the installed CLIs, asks which agents and which of their models to use, and keeps the roster either for the project in `.coddy/crossreview.json` or for all projects in `${CODDY_HOME}/crossreview.json`, where earlier versions kept it too. The same skill installs in other agents from [EvilFreelancer/crossreview](https://github.com/EvilFreelancer/crossreview). |
| **`/rpa-init`** | Warms up context on a repository: reads the code, the documentation and the test code, sets up the dev environment the project documents, runs the tests, and writes a short report. Needs no brief. |
| **`/rpa-feat`** | Adds a feature strictly by BDD: plan, failing tests, implementation, green tests, the full suite, documentation and examples, the linter at the end. Needs a description of what to build. |
| **`/rpa-bugfix`** | Fixes a bug reproduction-test first, then the fix, then the full suite, then a short report. Needs the bug: expected against actual, and how to reproduce it. |
| **`/rpa-gen-rules`** | Writes or refreshes the project's agent rules for Cursor, Claude Code and Codex from what the repository actually contains. See [rules.md](rules.md#generating-rules). |

Once written they are ordinary skills in your home: edit them, `coddy skills disable <name>` them,
delete them, or update them from the marketplace. What the delivery will and will not do is
recorded in **`${CODDY_HOME}/skills/.bundled.json`** beside the skills it wrote:

- a skill it has never handed over is written;
- a skill you deleted stays deleted - it is not written again by the next start;
- a copy older than the one in the release is **replaced**, so `coddy update` brings the newer skill
  with it. A copy that declares no version at all counts as older - it predates these skills
  carrying one - and is replaced too;
- a copy that is newer is left exactly as it is. That is also how you keep an edit: raise the
  `metadata.version` of the copy in your home above the one the release carries, otherwise the next release
  that raises its own overwrites it;
- a copy Coddy cannot read - a `SKILL.md` behind permissions it does not have - is left whole. It is
  neither absent nor unversioned, and the delivery does not judge what it cannot open.

If `.bundled.json` is there but unreadable, the delivery stops for that run and says so rather than
guessing: read as an empty record it would claim nothing had ever been handed over, and write back
every skill you had deleted. Replacing a skill renames the old copy aside and the new one into
place; a process killed between the two leaves a backup and no skill, and the next run puts it back.

A home Coddy cannot write to - a read-only image, a locked-down account - is not an error: the
copies inside the binary answer instead, read-only, and only a skill that needs the files beside
its `SKILL.md` (`references/`, or the `scripts/` of `crossreview`) notices the difference. A delivered skill you deleted is not among them: the receipt says it was
handed over, so the binary does not offer it again as one you cannot delete.

`crossreview` and the `rpa-*` skills live in their own repositories, so the same skill works in
Claude Code, Codex or Cursor, and are vendored into `internal/skills/bundled/` (their `SKILL.md`,
`references/` and `scripts/`) by **`make skills-vendor`**; `scripts/bundled-skills.json` says where
each one comes from.

### The marketplace that comes with it

**`EvilFreelancer/rpa-skills`** - the catalogue the delivered `rpa-*` skills are published from - is a
**system source**: it is in effect the way the delivered skills are, without appearing in
`skills.sources` and without any file being written for it. So the rest of that collection is one
command away on a machine whose `config.yaml` has never been touched:

```bash
coddy skills sync                 # install everything the catalogue publishes
coddy plugin marketplace list     # every source in effect, and whether it resolves
```

It is an address and nothing more - Coddy contacts it only when you ask it to. Because it is not in
the config file there is nothing to take out of one: `coddy plugin marketplace remove` refuses it
(unless your `skills.sources` happens to name it as well, in which case it takes that redundant
entry out of the file and tells you the marketplace itself stays),
`DELETE /coddy/skills/sources` answers 400, and **Settings → Skills → Remote skill sources** shows the
row greyed out with its delete button disabled. To be rid of a skill it publishes, disable or delete
that skill (`coddy skills disable <name>`) rather than the catalogue.

`GET /coddy/skills/sources` names them under `system`, which is how a client knows which rows carry
no remove control.

![Remote skill sources with the built-in marketplace greyed out](../assets/skills/skills-system-source-dark-1280.png)

*Settings → Skills: the built-in `EvilFreelancer/rpa-skills` is listed and can be synced, but its
field and its delete button are disabled; a source you added yourself is editable as before.*

## Where to get skills

### skills.sh — community registry

The open agent skills ecosystem lives at **[https://skills.sh](https://skills.sh)**. Skills are plain GitHub repos with a `SKILL.md` file, compatible across agents that support the format (Cursor, Codex, Claude Code, Coddy, etc.).

Install via **`npx skills`** (Node.js required):

```bash
# Search the registry
npx skills find [query]

# Install a skill globally into ~/.agents/skills/
npx skills add <owner/repo@skill>

# Update all installed skills
npx skills update

# Check for updates
npx skills check
```

Global skills land in **`~/.agents/skills/`** — shared with any agent that reads that directory.

### skillsbd — Coddy-curated registry

**[https://neuraldeep.ru/skills](https://neuraldeep.ru/skills)** is the **skillsbd** registry, curated for Coddy specifically. Install its CLI:

```bash
npm install -g skillsbd
```

Key commands:

```bash
# Search the registry
npx skillsbd search [query]

# Install a skill
npx skillsbd install <name>

# List installed skills
npx skillsbd list
```

Skills from skillsbd are also installed into **`~/.agents/skills/`** by default, so Coddy picks them up automatically via the default `skills.dirs`.

You can also browse and install through the Coddy web UI: **Settings → Skills → Registry**.

---

## Install from a repository or marketplace API (agents standard)

Coddy can fetch skills itself, without any external CLI, from a **GitHub repo**, a **git URL**, or an **http(s) URL** to an [agents-standard](https://agents.md) `marketplace.json`. Configure sources under `skills.sources` and install them on demand — nothing is fetched automatically.

```yaml
skills:
  sources:
    - "EvilFreelancer/rpa-skills"                    # owner/repo shorthand (GitHub)
    - "artwist-polyakov/polyakov-claude-skills"      # a marketplace monorepo
    - "owner/repo@v1.2"                              # pin a branch or tag
    - "https://github.com/owner/single-skill.git"    # any git URL
    - "https://example.com/skills/marketplace.json"  # an API marketplace URL
```

### The `plugin` command (CLI and `/plugin` in chat)

Plugin and marketplace management uses one command surface, available identically as the
`coddy plugin ...` CLI and the built-in `/plugin` chat command (a deterministic slash command that
runs without an LLM turn, like `/compact`). It takes the words Claude Code takes:

```bash
coddy plugin marketplace add <owner/repo | url>          # add a marketplace: read its plugin list, install nothing
coddy plugin install <plugin>@<marketplace>              # install one plugin of an added marketplace
coddy plugin marketplace update [<marketplace>]          # refresh the list and the plugins installed from it (alias: sync)
coddy plugin marketplace list [<marketplace>]            # marketplaces and sources, or the plugins of one marketplace
coddy plugin marketplace remove <marketplace | source>   # remove a marketplace or a source; installed skills stay
coddy plugin install <owner/repo | url>                  # install every skill a source publishes, kept in sync
coddy plugin remove <name>                               # delete an installed skill (bundled = read-only)
coddy plugin enable <name>   |   plugin disable <name>   # toggle a skill
coddy plugin list                                        # installed skills with versions
```

In chat the same words follow `/plugin`. Installing one skill from the
[neuraldeep.ru](https://neuraldeep.ru) catalogue, for example:

```text
/plugin marketplace add https://neuraldeep.ru/skapi/marketplace.json
/plugin install yandex-wordstat@neuraldeep
```

and in a terminal:

```bash
coddy plugin marketplace add https://neuraldeep.ru/skapi/marketplace.json
coddy plugin install yandex-wordstat@neuraldeep
```

- **`marketplace add`** reads the marketplace's `marketplace.json` and remembers it under the `name` it
  gives (`neuraldeep` above), with the list of plugins it publishes; it installs none of them. Adding
  it again refreshes that list and answers that the marketplace is added already. A source with no
  `marketplace.json`, or whose `marketplace.json` gives no name, cannot be added; install it whole
  with `plugin install <source>` instead. The added marketplaces live in
  `${CODDY_HOME}/skills/.marketplaces.json`, not in `config.yaml`.
- **`install <plugin>@<marketplace>`** installs one plugin of an added marketplace, found by that
  name. It reads the marketplace again first, so a plugin the marketplace published after it was
  added installs without an update. A marketplace that is not added, or a plugin it does not list,
  is an error that says what to run.
- **`marketplace update <marketplace>`** reads the marketplace again and reinstalls the plugins
  installed from it; the ones never installed stay so. It works per plugin: a skill removed with
  `plugin remove` comes back while another skill of the same plugin is still installed. Without a name it does that for every added
  marketplace and syncs every source, which is also what `coddy skills sync` does.
- **`install <owner/repo | url>`** (no `@`) installs every skill the source publishes, as before: it
  adds the source to `skills.sources`, and every sync installs and updates all of its plugins. A
  source already in `skills.sources` keeps that contract, including the built-in `EvilFreelancer/rpa-skills`.
- **`marketplace list`** probes each added marketplace and each source and reports whether it is a
  **valid marketplace** (agents standard, with its name, version, and plugin count), a repo with **no
  marketplace.json** (skills discovered directly), or **unreachable**; with a name it lists the plugins
  of that marketplace and marks the installed ones.

`marketplace remove <marketplace>` forgets an added marketplace and, when its source is in
`skills.sources` as well, takes it out of there too; the skills installed from it stay until
`plugin remove <name>`. `install` and `marketplace add` touch only what they name: another source
that is unreachable does not fail them.

**Changed in this release.** `plugin marketplace add` used to write the source into `skills.sources`
and install every plugin it lists. It now only adds the marketplace; install its plugins one by one
with `plugin install <plugin>@<marketplace>`, or keep the old behaviour with
`plugin install <owner/repo | url>`. Sources that are already in `skills.sources` are not touched and
keep having every plugin installed.

The lower-level `coddy skills` commands remain for skill files themselves:

```bash
coddy skills list                                      # all skills (with a VERSION column)
coddy skills enable <name>  |  disable <name>
coddy skills add <src>  |  sync  |  remove <name>      # remote source install (see below)
```

Three surfaces stay in parity — pick whichever fits:

- **CLI** — `coddy plugin ...` (and `coddy skills ...`).
- **Chat** — the `/plugin ...` command.
- **Web UI** — **Settings → Skills → Remote skill sources** (add a source, **Sync**, remove a source,
  **Refresh** to check versions, and a per-skill **Update** button when a newer version exists). The
  install search there also offers the plugins of the added marketplaces.

### Versions and updates

A marketplace `marketplace.json` may declare a `version` per plugin (semantic version), and a skill's
`SKILL.md` frontmatter may carry its own under the Agent Skills `metadata` map:

```yaml
---
name: rpa-feat
metadata:
  version: 1.0.1
description: ...
---
```

A top-level `version:` key, the form older skills used, is still read; `metadata.version` wins when a
file has both. Coddy records the installed version in the
`${CODDY_HOME}/skills/.remote.json` lockfile and shows it in `coddy skills list`, `coddy plugin list`,
the HTTP skill rows, and the Settings UI. `coddy plugin marketplace sync` (or the UI **Refresh**
button, backed by `GET /coddy/skills/updates`) re-reads each source's manifest and reports which skills
have a newer version upstream; the per-skill **Update** button (or `POST /coddy/skills/{name}/update`)
re-syncs just that skill's source to install it. Version-less plugins are shown without a version and
are never flagged for updates (no false positives).

A plugin published as a [zip archive](#plugins-published-as-zip-archives) whose entry declares no
`version` is recorded at a version made from the archive itself: `sha256:` and the first 12 hex digits
of its SHA-256, so the lockfile changes whenever the archive does. When the marketplace entry declares
the archive's `sha256`, the update check compares the two, and any change counts as an update (a digest
has no order). An entry without either is not flagged; `plugin marketplace sync` still downloads it
again and records the new version.

### How a source is resolved

1. `owner/repo` shorthands and git URLs are cloned (`git clone --depth 1`, refreshed with `git pull --ff-only`); an API URL is downloaded as JSON.
2. If the repo (or API response) is an agents-standard **marketplace** (`.agents/plugins/marketplace.json` or `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`), each listed plugin is resolved:
   - an **external** source (`{"source":"github","repo":"owner/repo"}` / `{"source":"url","url":"…","ref":"…"}`) is cloned;
   - an **archive** source (`{"source":"archive","url":"https://…/plugin.zip","sha256":"…"}`) is downloaded and unpacked, without git (see [below](#plugins-published-as-zip-archives));
   - a **relative** source (`"./plugins/foo"`) is read from inside the marketplace repo.
3. If there is **no manifest**, the repo is scanned directly for `SKILL.md`.
4. Every discovered skill directory (root `SKILL.md`, `skills/<name>/`, `.claude/skills/<name>/`, or `plugins/<p>/skills/<s>/`) is copied — with its sibling `scripts/`, `references/`, `examples/` — into `${CODDY_HOME}/skills/<name>/`, where the normal loader picks it up.

Provenance is tracked in `${CODDY_HOME}/skills/.remote.json`. Because synced skills live in a normal skills directory, `enable`/`disable` work on them like any other skill; `remove` deletes the copy (re-running `sync` re-installs it unless you also drop the source from `skills.sources`).

Private repositories rely on your ambient `git` credentials; API URLs and plugin archives are checked against the same SSRF guard used by the `webfetch` tool.

### Plugins published as zip archives

A marketplace can publish a plugin as a zip archive instead of a git repository, in the entry shape
Claude Code reads:

```json
{
  "name": "demo",
  "description": "A skill packed by its marketplace",
  "source": {
    "source": "archive",
    "url": "https://example.com/plugins/demo.zip",
    "sha256": "<64 hex digits, optional>"
  }
}
```

Only `"source": "archive"` selects this path: a `url` source whose address ends in `.zip` is still
cloned with git. Installing such a plugin (`coddy plugin install https://example.com/marketplace/demo.json`,
the same words after `/plugin` in chat, or the Settings install search) never starts git:

- **https only.** The archive address and every redirect on the way must be `https`, and each one
  passes the SSRF guard first, so loopback, private, shared (`100.64.0.0/10`) and link-local addresses
  and the cloud metadata endpoints are refused before any connection is made.
- **sha256.** When the entry declares one, it must be 64 hex digits and match the downloaded bytes on
  every download; otherwise the install is cancelled and nothing is written. A marketplace whose
  declared sha256 does not match the archive it serves fails every install of that plugin until the
  marketplace fixes the entry.
- **Limits.** At most 50 MiB downloaded, 200 MiB unpacked and 10,000 entries per archive.
- **Entries.** An entry with a `..` element, an absolute path or a drive letter, an entry that is a
  symbolic link, a device, a pipe or a socket, and a file that appears twice refuse the whole archive;
  every entry is checked before the first is written, and nothing is written outside a temporary
  folder. The `__MACOSX` folder the macOS archiver adds is checked the same way and then skipped.
- **Plugin root and its skills.** The plugin root is the top of the archive, or the single folder that
  wraps everything (the way GitHub packs a repository). When it carries a plugin manifest,
  `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` (or `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`), only the skills the manifest names are
  installed: the folders its `skills` field lists (a path or a list of paths relative to the root, each
  a skill folder or a folder of skill folders; a path that leaves the root is ignored), or the folders
  under `skills/` when it lists none, or, when `skills/` holds no skill folder either, the plugin root
  itself if it has a `SKILL.md`: a plugin that is one skill, named by the `name` of that `SKILL.md`,
  else by the plugin's. A `SKILL.md` elsewhere in the plugin, in its test data or examples, is not
  taken for a skill, and a skill must be a folder: a flat `skills/<name>.md` is not one. An archive
  without a manifest is searched for every `SKILL.md`, as a clone is; a git plugin is searched that
  way too, so its root `SKILL.md` is found as well.
- **Executable scripts.** A file the archive marks executable is written `0755`, any other `0644`.

The lockfile records the archive address next to the marketplace, and the version as described in
[Versions and updates](#versions-and-updates).

## Directory layout

![Settings, Skills tab: auto-discovery, the resolved skills.dirs, remote sources and installed skills](../assets/screenshot-fullhd-settings-skills.png)

*Settings, Skills tab: auto-discovery, the resolved skills.dirs, the remote sources with the built-in one greyed out, and the installed skills, the bundled ones among them*

Coddy searches all directories in `skills.dirs` and deduplicates by skill name. **Later directories have higher priority** — if the same skill name appears in multiple directories, the version from the directory listed last wins.

Default directories (lowest → highest priority):

| Priority | Path | Purpose |
|----------|------|---------|
| lowest | `~/.agents/skills/` | Global skills installed by `npx skills` / `npx skillsbd` — shared with all agents |
| ↑ | `~/.coddy/skills/` | Coddy-specific skills; may contain symlinks into `~/.agents/skills/` |
| highest | `${CWD}/.coddy/skills/` | Project-local skills — override anything from global/user directories |

Override in `config.yaml`:

```yaml
skills:
  dirs:
    - "~/.agents/skills"
    - "${CODDY_HOME}/skills"
    - "${CWD}/.coddy/skills"
    - "~/my-team-skills"
```

`${CODDY_HOME}` expands when the config file is loaded; `${CWD}` stays in the entry and expands per session, against the workspace of the session that loads its skills.

A skill may be a symbolic link that leads anywhere on the disk, outside the project included: a skill folder linked into `.coddy/skills` (`ln -s ~/shared-skills/review .coddy/skills/review`), a single `.md` skill file linked the same way, a `SKILL.md` that is itself a link, or the whole `.coddy/skills` directory as a link to a folder of skills. Every form is listed, invoked with `/name` and offered to `load_skill`; the model is told the skill's folder by its path through the link (`Skill directory: <project>/.coddy/skills/review`), so the files the skill names (`scripts/`, `references/`) are read and run from there. A link that leads nowhere is skipped. Deleting such a skill from Settings → Skills removes the link and leaves what it points at; when the whole skills directory is a link, the skill folder inside it is what gets deleted, as in any folder.

`${CWD}` is resolved by the session, not by the process. A `coddy serve` server started from any directory (a user service started from `$HOME`, say) serves project-local skills to every session whose workspace is that project: pick the folder when the session is created (the composer's workspace picker, `POST /coddy/sessions/{id}/workspace`, or ACP `session/new` with `cwd`). The workspace is fixed once the conversation has messages, so a running chat keeps the skills of the folder it started in. `GET /coddy/slash-commands` and `GET /coddy/skills` take the session through **`X-Coddy-Session-ID`**; without it they describe the folder in the **`cwd`** query, and without both the server default workspace, which is also what `coddy skills list` prints for the directory it runs in.

A new chat in the web UI has no session until its first message, so the folder picked on the start screen travels as the **`cwd`** query of those requests instead. Picking `data` and typing `/` lists the project skills of `data/.coddy/skills` at once, next to the global ones; pick a folder without them and they leave the menu, and a `/name` of another workspace is no longer marked as a skill in the composer or in the messages of the transcript. Settings → Skills lists the project skills of the same folder, and once the first message is sent the session is created in it, so the turn loads the same skills.

---

## Supported file formats

### `subdir/SKILL.md` (recommended)

One skill per directory. Compatible with the standard agent skills layout and `npx skills`:

```
~/.agents/skills/
  code-review/
    SKILL.md
  docker-helper/
    SKILL.md
```

### Root `.md` / `.mdc` in a skill directory

Flat files at the root of a `skills.dirs` entry also register as skills (stem becomes the slash name).

### YAML frontmatter

Each skill file must have a frontmatter block with exactly two fields — both required and non-empty:

```markdown
---
name: code-review
description: One-line summary shown in the slash-command catalog and UI.
---

# Code Review

Full skill body here...
```

`name` sets the canonical slash-command identifier (e.g. `/code-review`). It overrides the filesystem-derived name when set. `description` is shown in the catalog and the Settings → Skills panel.

Two optional fields pick what the skill runs on. `model` names a configured model id and `reasoning` (alias `effort`) a level that model offers, `off` or `default`; when the skill is invoked, by `/code-review` in a prompt or by the model's `load_skill`, they apply for the rest of that turn and the session's own settings return with the next one ([Session settings](session-settings.md#changing-the-model-on-request)):

```markdown
---
name: code-review
description: Review the pending change for correctness.
model: rpa/qwen3.8-27b
reasoning: high
---
```

---

## Enable / disable without uninstalling

```bash
coddy skills list              # show all skills with enabled/disabled status
coddy skills disable <name>    # skip a skill without removing it
coddy skills enable <name>     # re-enable
```

Disabled state is stored in `~/.coddy/skills/.disabled` (plain text, one name per line).

---

## Writing your own skill

Create a directory anywhere and add `SKILL.md`:

```markdown
---
name: my-skill
description: Short description shown in the catalog.
---

# My skill

Instructions the agent will follow when this skill is active.
```

Then add the parent directory to `skills.dirs` in `config.yaml`, or drop the directory into `~/.coddy/skills/` or `${CWD}/.coddy/skills/`.

In a running agent session, committing a change to `skills.dirs`, `skills.sources`, or `skills.auto_discovery` through the staged config tools (`config_set` + `config_commit`) immediately rebuilds the skill catalog. An external installer such as `coddy plugin install` or `npx skills add` changes files on disk, so follow it with an idempotent commit of `set skills.dirs=[...]` to refresh the running loader. Adding an entry to `skills.sources` alone still does not fetch or install anything.

To share it with others, publish to GitHub and list it on [skills.sh](https://skills.sh) or submit to [neuraldeep.ru/skills](https://neuraldeep.ru/skills).

---

## When skills are read

A session reads its skills from disk when it starts (the console's first
session, `session/new` or `session/load` over ACP, a new chat in the web UI),
when its workspace changes and when the configuration is reloaded; nothing
is read over the network for that.

- **Read at the start, bodies included**: every `SKILL.md` (and root `.md` /
  `.mdc` skill file) of the folders in `skills.dirs` and of the managed
  folder, about 0.1 ms per skill, so a thousand installed skills add some
  100 ms to the console's first frame; the skills built into the binary are
  held in memory.
- **Never read at the start**: `skills.sources`. A source's manifest or
  repository is fetched only when someone asks for it - `coddy skills sync`,
  `coddy plugin marketplace sync` and `/plugin`, Settings → Skills
  (**Refresh**, **Update**), `GET /coddy/skills/updates` - so a large
  marketplace, or a source that does not answer, never delays a session.

What can hold a start up are the configured MCP servers; the console
connects them after its first frame ([MCP servers](mcp.md#mcp-server-lifecycle)).

## How skills are applied

On each `session/prompt` the agent:

1. Uses the skills the session read from `skills.dirs` for its cwd and `CODDY_HOME` ([When skills are read](#when-skills-are-read)).
2. All loaded (and enabled) skills are always active — their bodies are available as slash commands and injected on demand.
3. Builds the **`{{.Skills}}`** system-prompt block: the slash-command catalog listing all skills, plus the full body of any always-active or glob-matched skill whose name is **not** already in the catalog.
4. Looks for `/name` invocations in the text the user typed and **appends each matched skill's body to the user message**, as a `<coddy_attachment path="skill:name" kind="skill">` element after the typed text. The message goes into **session history with the body in it**, so later turns replay the same bytes: the provider's cached prefix holds, and the model keeps the instructions it was given until a compaction folds the message into its summary ([Mentions and the prompt cache](mentions.md#mentions-and-the-prompt-cache)). The transcript shows the message as typed, because the web UI drops `kind="skill"` elements, and so does the history replay a reopened console or an ACP editor receives. A follow-up queued during a turn gets its skill bodies the same way.

A body the model loads itself with the `load_skill` tool (offered while `skills.auto_discovery` is on) comes back as the result of that call and stays in session history like any other tool result.

Either way, a skill that is a folder on disk arrives headed by one line, `Skill directory: <path>`, the folder its `SKILL.md` was read from. A skill names its own files - `scripts/`, `references/` - by relative path, and without the line a model has to search the disk for them. A skill of the standard delivery that is read out of the binary (when `skills.dirs` does not list `${CODDY_HOME}/skills`) is pointed at the copy the delivery wrote there; with no such copy on disk there is no line.

ACP clients receive `available_commands_update` after `session/new` and `session/load`. The HTTP UI queries `GET /coddy/slash-commands` for autocomplete.
